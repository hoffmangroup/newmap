Newmap documentation
====================

**Newmap** is a set of tools for quantifying mappability for any sequence. It
accomplishes this by looking for k-mers that will uniquely map to all positions
in your sequence. For a given length k, Newmap can then output a single-read
mappability BED file and/or a multi-read mappability wig file.
