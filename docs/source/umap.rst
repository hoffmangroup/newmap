Umap
====

Newmap is intended to be a simple, faster, and easy to use replacement for the
orignal `Umap <https://bismap.hoffmanlab.org>`_ project.

Umap dataset differences
------------------------

There are some minor differences between the file output generated by Umap and
newmap. Newmap aims to an improvement in both usefulness and accuracy.

unique.uint8
^^^^^^^^^^^^
There are minor differences between the ``unique.uint8`` datasets that would have been generated from
Umap, and the current datasets generated from newmap.

1. Only the following k-mer lengths were in Umap: 24,36,50,100,150,200
2. K-mers overlapping specifically with dinucleotide sequence ``N`` were not
   considered unique and were excluded as candidates. Notably this criteria
   did not include any soft-masked regions with ``n`` or all other possible
   ambiguous characters.

Mappability files
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The mappability files generated by newmap are different from the original Umap
by 1 bp on the start coordinate due to an off-by-one bug for both multi-read
mappability and single-read mappability in Umap.
