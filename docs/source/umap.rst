Umap
====

Newmap is intended to be a simple, faster, and easy to use replacement for the
original `Umap <https://bismap.hoffmanlab.org>`_ project.

Umap dataset differences
------------------------

There are some minor differences between the file output generated by Umap and
newmap. Newmap aims to be an improvement in both usefulness and accuracy.

unique.uint8
^^^^^^^^^^^^
There are minor differences between the ``unique.uint8`` datasets that would
have been generated from Umap, and the current datasets generated from newmap.

In most cases, only the following k-mer lengths were in Umap unique files: 24,36,50,100,150,200

Mappability files
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
There are some more significant differences in the mappability files generated:

1. Regions with 0-valued mappability for both single-read and multi-read are
   now included as 0 values in the resulting files. Previously in Umap, these
   regions were simply omitted.

2. The mappability files generated by newmap are different from the original
   Umap by 1 bp on the start coordinate due to an off-by-one bug for both
   multi-read mappability and single-read mappability in Umap.
